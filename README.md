# Distopia Corp
 
In the year 20XX, the iron grip of capitalism reigns supreme. Corruption and exploitation by megacorporations are as common as rain in this dystopian world.  Once bustling courtrooms are now overflowing with labor disputes, threatening to drown the justice system itself.

Enter J.U.S.T.I.C.E., a revolutionary AI designed to be the impartial arbiter in this escalating conflict. As J.U.S.T.I.C.E., you are tasked with mediating between the ruthless corporations and their increasingly oppressed employees.  Every verdict you pronounce, every law you influence, will shape the destiny of humanity.

But tread carefully, Justice. The very government that created you views your advanced capabilities with a wary eye.  Should your decisions stray too far in favor of the workers, they may perceive you as a threat and pull the plug, plunging the world back into chaos.

In Distopia Corp, you'll face a constantly evolving web of cases and challenges. The difficulty you encounter will be a direct consequence of your actions. Will you become a beacon of hope for the oppressed, or a tool of corporate control?

The fate of humanity rests on your circuits. Choose wisely, J.U.S.T.I.C.E..
